# A Night In

## Description

We wanted to create an application that allows users to find new and exciting recipes based on a desired meal and their favorite cocktail ingredients. Users can display recipe instructions and ingredients, as well as save their favorite combos to local storage to display at a later date. We learned how to parse information from multiple APIs to create custom Javascript functions and generate dynamic HTML elements based on API information.

## Installation
